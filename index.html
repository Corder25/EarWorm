            Beach House is the debut studio album by American dream pop duo
            Beach House. It was released on October 3, 2006, by Carpark Records
            and in Europe by Bella Union. The album received mostly positive
            reviews from music critics. The album had a remastered reissue in
            2010 by HeartBreakBeat Records with a run limited to 1,000 copies on
            black vinyl. In 2012, a pressing on special edition white vinyl was
            released through Bella Union. In 2015, the band self-released a
            white cassette during the Depression Cherry tour. As of April 2012
            Beach House has sold 24,000 copies in United States according to
            Nielsen Soundscan. The album was recorded on a 4-track over a two
            day period in Scally's basement.

            Beach House's second album, Devotion, was released on February 26,
            2008. It was received with similar acclaim as the first album and
            was likewise included in Pitchfork's Best Albums of 2008 list. On
            October 21, 2008, the group released the single "Used to Be". Beach
            House also recorded a cover of Queen's "Play the Game" for the
            iTunes Store release of the Red Hot Organization's 2009 compilation
            Dark Was The Night. In 2009, Legrand provided backing vocals on the
            song "Two Weeks" by the indie rock band Grizzly Bear. She later
            collaborated with the band again by providing vocals to "Slow Life",
            the band's contribution to the soundtrack for the film Twilight: New
            Moon. In October 2010, the band contributed a charity T-shirt for
            the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for the House of Ruth women's
            shelter in Maryland for victims of domestic violence.

            Teen Dream, the duo's "dynamic and intense" third album, was
            released on Sub Pop on January 26, 2010. It was released in the UK
            by Bella Union and in Mexico by Arts & Crafts. It contains a newer
            version of their 2008 single "Used to Be". Meanwhile, "Norway", the
            first single off ''Teen Dream'', was made available as a free
            download on the band's website on November 17, 2009; it was later
            promoted on iTunes as the Free Single of the Week starting January
            12, 2010. The album was produced and engineered by Chris Coady (Yeah
            Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio, Grizzly Bear). Music videos were made
            both for songs, "Silver Soul" and "Real Love", created by famed
            collective, The Masses. The album's unanimously positive reviews
            garnered the band a larger fan base, with Jay-Z and Beyoncé being
            spotted at the band's shows. Teen Dream was listed as number 5 on
            Pitchfork's Top 50 Albums of 2010 with the following notes: Teen
            Dream did little to alter Beach House's core
            characteristics---slow-motion beats layered with hazy keyboard
            drones, rippling guitar figures, and Victoria Legrand's melancholic
            melodies---but greatly amplified them to the point of redefining the
            band's essence, from that of introverted knee-gazers into an
            assured, emotionally assertive force. -- Stuart Berman Of the
            success of the album and it being dubbed the group's "breakout"
            record by numerous publications, Legrand stated: "I see this as just
            another step in a direction. I would not want to say that 2010 will
            be our year, necessarily, I hope it’s just another year in which we
            do good work. I don’t want to be defined by this year, I want it to
            just be a beginning." The album was also included in the book 1001
            Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

            On March 7, 2012 the band streamed a new song, "Myth", from their
            website. The album Bloom was released on May 15, 2012 via Sub Pop. A
            second song from the album, "Lazuli", was released on April 13,
            2012.[21] Beach House was featured on the cover of Issue #80 of the
            Fader. A music video for "Lazuli" was released on June 6, 2012. It
            was directed by Allen Cordell, who also directed the video for "Walk
            in the Park" from Teen Dream. A music video for the track "Wild" has
            also been released. A music video for "Wishes" directed by Eric
            Wareheim and starring Ray Wise was released on March 7, 2013. The
            band released a short film, Forever Still, on February 4, 2013. The
            film, directed by the band and Max Goldman, was inspired by Pink
            Floyd's Live at Pompeii and features the band performing songs from
            Bloom at various sites around Tornillo, Texas, where the album was
            recorded. The idea for the film came from the band's desire to make
            quality promotional content they could control artistically: "We had
            previously been involved in too many live sessions, radio tapings,
            photoshoots, etc., where the outcome was far below our personal
            artistic standards. We also felt a need to distance ourselves from
            the 'content' culture of the internet that rewards quantity over
            quality and shock over nuance."

            On May 26, 2015, the band announced their fifth album Depression
            Cherry. It was released on August 28 via Sub Pop (on Bella Union in
            the UK)[28] and the band announced a world tour in support. Talking
            about the direction of the new album, the band said, "In general,
            this record shows a return to simplicity, with songs structured
            around a melody and a few instruments, with live drums playing a far
            lesser role. With the growing success of Teen Dream and Bloom, the
            larger stages and bigger rooms naturally drove us towards a louder,
            more aggressive place; a place farther from our natural tendencies.
            Here, we continue to let ourselves evolve while fully ignoring the
            commercial context in which we exist."[29] "I think, this album
            continues to change meaning for me. But if anything, it's full of
            many things. Love, pain, getting older, dealing with loss, letting
            go. It's really ultimately whatever the listener feels in response
            to it," has Legrand described.[30] "The name Depression Cherry is
            like a dance between these two energies. That very abstract feeling
            summed up the energy field of the record for us," specifies
            Victoria.[31] This LP received praise from critics.[32]

            On October 7, 2015, the band announced a sixth album, entitled Thank
            Your Lucky Stars, which was released on October 16, 2015. On
            September 28, 2015, popular music webzine Spin reported that the
            band had performed a new song called "Helicopter Dream (I'm Awake)"
            on Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne's new podcast. Other music
            webzines also reported on the purported new track, including
            Consequence of Sound, Fact, and Stereogum. However, according to the
            band's representatives, the song was a fake. In an email to Spin,
            their representatives state, "It is not a new song. Not even their
            voices on that podcast. Sorry!" This led to a thinkpiece from the
            gossip blog Gawker, which used the hoax as an example of "how easy
            it is to fool a blogger". Notably, reaction to the fake track was
            largely favorable, with Spin calling it a "fuzzy space-odyssey" and
            Consequence of Sound describing it as "a reverb-soaked number."[35]
            Even the band itself gave a positive review, tweeting, "To whoever
            made that fake podcast interview, we like your helicopter dream
            song." The fake song and podcast hoax was named by Vice's Noisey as
            one of "The Best Trolls of 2015."

            addition, they announced that they were working on a compilation of
            B-Sides and rarities. The compilation, B-Sides and Rarities, was
            eventually released on June 30, 2017, and was supported by a new
            song, "Chariot", which served as the lead single of the compilation
            and one of the two previously unreleased songs on it. Band describes
            that it felt like a good step for them. It helped them to clean the
            creative closet, put the past to bed, and start anew.

            On February 15, 2018, the band released a new song, "Lemon Glow,"
            and announced it as the lead single from their then-upcoming album
            which they said would be released "later this spring." On March 7,
            the band released another single from the album, "Dive", alongside
            an announcement of the album's title. 7 is the seventh studio album
            by Beach House, released on May 11, 2018, through Sub Pop. It
            follows the B-Sides and Rarities compilation album released in 2017,
            which served as a proverbial "cleaning out the closet" to pave the
            way for a new creative process. The album saw the group's departure
            from longtime producer Chris Coady. 7 was co-produced by Beach House
            and Pete “Sonic Boom” Kember. His work with Spacemen 3 and Spectrum
            impressed the band to reach out and see if he might like to
            co-produce the album with them. The record also features drums from
            James Barone, the band's longtime live drummer. Throughout the
            process of recording 7, the band's goal was rebirth and
            rejuvenation. They wanted to rethink old methods and shed some
            self-imposed limitations. In the past, they've often limited their
            writing to parts that they can perform live. On 7, they decided to
            follow whatever came naturally. As a result, there are some songs
            with no guitar, and some without keyboard. There are songs with
            layers and production that they could never recreate live, and that
            was exciting to them. Basically, letting creative moods, instead of
            instrumentation, dictate the album’s feel. ‘’This album felt really
            kinetic. We tend to make pretty still music, and this record felt
            like we were really excited by the kind of bubbling, chaotic,
            discordant energy field. … The vibe and the show are getting more
            energetic and messy, but in what I think is a cool way. Maybe a
            little bit more “rock and roll,” to use the old term,’’ adds Scally.
            On October 23, 2018, the band released a limited edition 7-inch
            vinyl of "Lose Your Smile" from 7 as the A-side and a new track from
            the recording sessions of 7 titled "Alien" as the B-side. The vinyl
            was originally sold on the band's European tour in dates from
            September to October. In addition, "Alien" was released as a
            standalone single to digital download and streaming services.
